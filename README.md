# Western Wilson

Kia ora 👋

I’m [Western](https://westernwilson.com), a curious problem solver who works in Tech, with full stack experience and a deeper experience with infrastructure/devops.

Receently I completed Google’s [**Machine Learning Crash Course**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), focusing on:

- Supervised learning (linear & logistic regression)
- Model evaluation (loss, accuracy, precision, recall, AUC)
- Preparing data for ML (numerical & categorical features, feature engineering)
- Introductory neural networks and how ML systems run in production

I'm looking into the Agentic AI and how that can be applied to solve a pain point in my life.
